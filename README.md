This project implements a Fully Connected Neural Network with the algorithm built from scratch, without using high-level ML libraries. 
It uses a tkinter GUI to customize these 3 parameters : hidden layers, learning rate, and batch size. 
The network is trained on the MNIST dataset.
After training, it displays pyplot graphs for cost and accuracy over batches.
